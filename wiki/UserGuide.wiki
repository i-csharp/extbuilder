  === Editor View ===
  It’s a multi-pages editor contains a source code editor and a UI editor. 
  In source code editor, you can see the real code extbuilder generate for you. Please focus the initUIComponents function.
  In UI editor, you can see the UI created by you code.

  === Outline View ===
  The outline view is a component tree view. You can select specific component in the view. 

  === Properties View ===
  The most important view you have to deal. In this view, you can set the configuration of one component.
  For example: 
  For a Panel component, you may set the title property to ‘MyPanel’, the layout property to ‘Border’, the width property to ‘100’, etc.
  For a GridPanel component, you may set the store property and columns property.
  All you change make to a component take effect immediately. Both the code editor and UI editor will change. It’s a good way to watch your settings how change the UI to your wanted style.

  === Drag Components ===
  In UI editor, you can see a palette with some components in several folders.
  Now extbuilder supports most components in latest Ext 2.2
  You could click one component, such as a Panel then move the mouse to outline view, there must be a component named panel, it's the root component of one panel class. Click the mouse again, then the root panel component now have a child panel.
  In the way, you can use any components and organize the component tree as you wish.
  Although you may think drag a component and drop it to a canvas is better, but that means ExtBuilder need to implement all Ext components drawing,behavior and layout in Java code. From my opinion, this way is the fastest way to build a GUI page.
